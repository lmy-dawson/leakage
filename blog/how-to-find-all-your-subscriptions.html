                    <p>💡 <strong>Quick stat:</strong> Research shows the average person underestimates their monthly subscription spend by $133. What you think you're paying and what you're actually paying are rarely the same number.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Section 1 -->
                <h2 id="why-it-happens">Why forgotten subscriptions happen to everyone</h2>
                <p>It's not carelessness. It's just how subscriptions are designed.</p>
                <p>They start as free trials. You sign up, forget to cancel, and suddenly you're being charged $9.99 a month for something you used twice. Or a service quietly raises its price from $12 to $17 and you never notice because you're not looking at your bank statement line by line every month. Nobody does.</p>
                <p>The companies know this. <strong>The business model depends on it.</strong></p>
                <p>The good news is there's a simple process to find every single subscription you're paying for right now. It takes about 20–30 minutes and the savings are usually immediate.</p>

                <!-- Method 1 -->
                <h2 id="method-1">Method 1: Search your email inbox</h2>
                <p>Your email is the most complete record of every service you've ever signed up for. Here's how to use it.</p>

                <div class="step-box">
                    <div class="step-number">Step 1</div>
                    <h3 style="margin-top:8px;">Search for billing keywords</h3>
                    <p>Open your email and search for these terms one at a time:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"receipt"</li>
                        <li>"invoice"</li>
                        <li>"subscription"</li>
                        <li>"your payment"</li>
                        <li>"billing"</li>
                        <li>"thank you for your purchase"</li>
                        <li>"renewal"</li>
                        <li>"free trial"</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Go through each set of results and note every service that appears. You'll be surprised what comes up.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step-box">
                    <div class="step-number">Step 2</div>
                    <h3 style="margin-top:8px;">Filter by sender</h3>
                    <p>Look for emails from payment processors like PayPal, Stripe, and your bank. These often contain charges you wouldn't find by searching for service names directly — because the billing name on your statement is sometimes different from the product name you remember.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="callout">
                    <p>⚠️ <strong>Watch out for annual subscriptions.</strong> These are the sneakiest. You signed up last year, forgot completely, and now you're being charged again. Search your email for emails from exactly 12 months ago to catch these.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Method 2 -->
                <h2 id="method-2">Method 2: Go through your bank statement line by line</h2>
                <p>This is more tedious but the most accurate method because it shows you what's actually leaving your account — not just what you signed up for.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Download your last 3 months of bank statements as a PDF or CSV</li>
                    <li>Look for any charge that appears more than once at the same amount</li>
                    <li>Highlight anything you don't immediately recognise</li>
                    <li>Google the name of anything unfamiliar — billing names are often shortened or use company legal names rather than the product name</li>
                    <li>Make a list of every recurring charge with the amount and frequency</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Common charges people don't recognise include things like "AMZN Digital" (Amazon Prime or Kindle Unlimited), "APPL*" charges (Apple subscriptions), or "Google*" (Google One storage). These are easy to miss if you're not looking carefully.</p>

                <h3>What to look for specifically</h3>
                <p>Subscriptions usually appear as the same amount on the same date every month. Look for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Charges between $5–$30 that repeat monthly</li>
                    <li>Charges between $50–$200 that repeat annually</li>
                    <li>Small charges under $5 — these are easy to overlook but add up</li>
                    <li>Any charge you can't immediately name</li>
                </ul>

                <!-- Method 3 -->
                <h2 id="method-3">Method 3: Check your phone app store subscriptions</h2>
                <p>This one catches a lot of people. Apps you downloaded once and never opened again can still be charging you monthly.</p>

                <div class="step-box">
                    <div class="step-number">iPhone / iOS</div>
                    <h3 style="margin-top:8px;">Find your Apple subscriptions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Open Settings on your iPhone</li>
                        <li>Tap your name at the top</li>
                        <li>Tap "Subscriptions"</li>
                        <li>You'll see every active and recently expired subscription through Apple</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <div class="step-box">
                    <div class="step-number">Android / Google</div>
                    <h3 style="margin-top:8px;">Find your Google Play subscriptions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Open the Google Play Store app</li>
                        <li>Tap your profile picture in the top right</li>
                        <li>Tap "Payments & subscriptions"</li>
                        <li>Tap "Subscriptions" to see everything active</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <p>Go through both lists carefully. Cancel anything you haven't used in the last 30 days or don't plan to use in the next 30 days. You can always re-subscribe later.</p>

                <!-- Method 4 -->
                <h2 id="method-4">Method 4: Check PayPal and digital wallets</h2>
                <p>If you've ever paid for something with PayPal, there's a good chance you set up automatic payments that are still running.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Log into PayPal</li>
                    <li>Go to Settings → Payments → Manage automatic payments</li>
                    <li>You'll see every service that has permission to charge your PayPal automatically</li>
                    <li>Cancel anything you don't actively use</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Do the same for any other digital wallets you use — Google Pay, Apple Pay, or any buy-now-pay-later services you may have used in the past.</p>

                <!-- What to do -->
                <h2 id="what-to-do">What to do once you find them</h2>
                <p>Once you have your full list, go through it and ask one question for each subscription:</p>

                <div class="callout">

                </div>

                <p>If the answer is no — cancel it immediately. Don't wait, don't give yourself time to second-guess. Companies make cancellation deliberately awkward, so do it while you're motivated.</p>

                <p>If the answer is yes — keep it, but note the price. Check if there's a cheaper plan or a competitor offering the same thing for less. Many services offer discounts if you simply ask, especially if you mention you're considering cancelling.</p>

                <h3>How to cancel subscriptions that make it difficult</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>For subscriptions with no cancel button:</strong> Email them directly asking to cancel and keep a record of the email</li>
                    <li><strong>For trials you can't find how to cancel:</strong> Contact your bank and ask them to block future charges from that company</li>
                    <li><strong>For subscriptions that auto-renewed without warning:</strong> You're often entitled to a refund — contact the company directly within a few days of the charge</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="never-again">How to never deal with this again</h2>
                <p>Going through this process once is good. But subscriptions accumulate again over time. Free trials, impulse purchases, price increases — it all adds up quietly.</p>

                <p>The real solution is something that watches your spending automatically and tells you when something needs attention — without requiring you to remember to check anything.</p>

                <p>That's exactly what Leakage does. Instead of you hunting through emails and bank statements every few months, Leakage monitors your recurring charges continuously and sends you a plain English alert the moment something changes, spikes, or looks like a waste.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A subscription you haven't used in months — you get an alert</li>
                    <li>A price that crept up quietly — you get an alert</li>
                    <li>A bill that's about to hit — you get an alert before it happens</li>
                    <li>A spending spike on food delivery — you get an alert with the exact number</li>
                </ul>

                <p>No dashboards to check. No spreadsheets to maintain. Just a message that tells you what's wrong and what to do about it.</p>
