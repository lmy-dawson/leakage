                <h2 id="the-numbers">The actual numbers</h2>
                <p>Multiple consumer research studies point to the same finding: the average person is wasting somewhere between <strong>$200 and $400 per year</strong> on subscriptions they either forgot about or no longer use.</p>
                <p>That works out to roughly <strong>$25–$35 every single month</strong> leaving your account silently — for services you're not getting any value from.</p>
                <p>To put that in perspective:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>$312 per year is roughly the cost of a return flight within Europe</li>
                    <li>It's 4 months of a gym membership</li>
                    <li>It's over 30 meals at a sit-down restaurant</li>
                    <li>It's almost exactly what most people budget for a birthday gift for a close friend</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It disappears quietly, in small amounts, over the course of the year — and most people never notice until they actually sit down and add it up.</p>

                <h2 id="underestimate">Why everyone underestimates their spending</h2>
                <p>Here's the part that surprises most people: when asked to guess their monthly subscription spending, people consistently underestimate by an average of $133 per month.</p>

                <div class="callout">
                    <p>💡 <strong>Think about it:</strong> If you're spending $200/month on subscriptions but only think you're spending $67, you have an invisible $133 hole in your budget that you're not accounting for anywhere.</p>
                </div>

                <p>There are a few reasons this gap exists:</p>

                <h3>Small amounts feel insignificant</h3>
                <p>A $7.99 charge doesn't feel like money leaving your account. Neither does $4.99 or $9.99. But when you're paying 8–12 of these simultaneously, the total is very much real money. Our brains aren't wired to add up lots of small numbers automatically.</p>

                <h3>Annual subscriptions are invisible for 11 months</h3>
                <p>You signed up for something, paid for a year, and completely forgot about it. Then 12 months later it renews and you're surprised — but you've already mentally "spent" that money so it doesn't feel like a current cost. Annual subscriptions are some of the most expensive forgotten charges precisely because they're so infrequent.</p>

                <h3>Billing names are confusing</h3>
                <p>When you scan your bank statement and see "AMZN Digital" or "APPL*" you might mentally file it under "Amazon" or "Apple" without realising those are 3 separate charges for 3 different services from the same company. The cognitive shortcut of recognising a familiar company name stops you from examining the charge more closely.</p>

                <h3>We avoid looking at our bank statements</h3>
                <p>This is the most honest reason. Most people glance at their bank balance to make sure nothing alarming happened, and then move on. A detailed line-by-line review of transactions happens rarely — if ever. Subscriptions exploit this completely.</p>

                <h2 id="categories">Where the money actually goes</h2>
                <p>When people audit their subscriptions, the charges tend to cluster in predictable categories. Here's roughly how the waste breaks down:</p>

                <h2 id="subscription-creep">The subscription creep problem</h2>
                <p>Even if you audit your subscriptions today and cancel everything unnecessary, the problem comes back. This is called subscription creep — the gradual accumulation of charges over time that happens to everyone.</p>
                <p>It works like this:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You sign up for a free trial of something useful</li>
                    <li>You forget to cancel before it converts to paid</li>
                    <li>Six months later you're still paying for it without realising</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile a service you already pay for quietly raises its price by $3</li>
                    <li>And you sign up for something else during a sale</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Within a year you're back to where you started — or worse. The only way to break the cycle is continuous monitoring, not periodic audits.</p>

                <div class="callout">
                    <p>📊 <strong>The maths of subscription creep:</strong> If you acquire just 2 new forgotten subscriptions per year at an average of $10/month each, and each of your existing subscriptions increases by $1/month annually, within 3 years you're paying an extra $60+ per month without ever making a conscious spending decision.</p>
                </div>

                <h2 id="fix-it">What to do about it</h2>
                <p>There are two levels of response here — a one-time fix and an ongoing solution.</p>

                <h3>The one-time fix</h3>
                <p>Do a full subscription audit right now. Go through your email, your bank statement, your phone app subscriptions, and your PayPal automatic payments. Cancel everything you haven't used in the last 30 days or don't plan to use in the next 30 days. Our guide on <a href="/blog/how-to-find-all-your-subscriptions" style="color:#4ade80;">how to find every subscription you're paying for</a> walks through this step by step.</p>
                <p>Most people save $40–$100 per month from a single audit. That's real money back in your pocket immediately.</p>

                <h3>The ongoing solution</h3>
                <p>A one-time audit is a starting point, not a solution. The subscriptions will accumulate again within months. What you actually need is something that watches your spending continuously and tells you when something needs attention — before months of wasted charges pile up.</p>
                <p>That's what Leakage is built for. It monitors your recurring charges automatically and sends you a plain English alert the moment something looks like a waste — a service you haven't used, a price that crept up, a bill about to hit. No dashboards, no spreadsheets. Just a message that tells you what's wrong and what to do.</p>
