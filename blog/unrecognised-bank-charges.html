                    <p>💡 <strong>Quick fact:</strong> The billing name on your bank statement is the legal trading name of the company — which is often completely different from the product or app name you actually use.</p>
                </div>

                <h2 id="why-confusing">Why billing names are so confusing</h2>
                <p>When a company charges you, your bank shows the merchant name they registered with — not the name of the app or service you signed up for. These are often completely different things.</p>
                <p>For example, you sign up for a meditation app called "Calm." But the company's legal billing name might be "Calm.com Inc" or just "CALM*CALM.COM" — and that's exactly what appears on your statement. Now multiply that across 10-15 services and your bank statement becomes almost unreadable.</p>
                <p>There are a few other reasons charges look strange:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Parent companies:</strong> A small app you use might be owned by a larger company whose name appears instead</li>
                    <li><strong>Payment processors:</strong> Some companies bill through Stripe, PayPal, or other processors and that name shows up instead</li>
                    <li><strong>Country of registration:</strong> International companies sometimes show billing names from their country of origin</li>
                    <li><strong>Truncation:</strong> Banks often cut off long names, making them even harder to identify</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="common-charges">The most common confusing charges decoded</h2>
                <p>Here are the billing names that appear on bank statements most often that people don't recognise:</p>

                <h2 id="how-to-identify">How to identify any unknown charge</h2>
                <p>If you see a charge and can't find it in the list above, here's the process to identify it in under 5 minutes:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Google the exact name:</strong> Copy the billing name exactly as it appears and search it. Add the word "subscription" or "charge" to the search. Most common ones are documented online.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check your email:</strong> Search your inbox for the company name — you almost certainly received a receipt or welcome email when you signed up.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check your phone subscriptions:</strong> Go to iPhone Settings → your name → Subscriptions, or Google Play → Payments & subscriptions. Many mystery charges come from apps.</li>
                    <li><strong>Call your bank:</strong> If none of the above works, your bank can often provide the full merchant name and website associated with the charge.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check PayPal automatic payments:</strong> PayPal → Settings → Payments → Manage automatic payments covers anything billed through PayPal.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="fraud-or-forgotten">Is it fraud or a forgotten subscription?</h2>
                <p>This is the most important question — and getting it wrong in either direction costs you.</p>

                <div class="callout">
                    <p>⚠️ <strong>Important:</strong> Most unrecognised charges are forgotten subscriptions, not fraud. Immediately disputing a charge as fraud when it's actually a legitimate subscription you forgot can cause complications with your account.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Signs it's a forgotten subscription</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The amount is the same every month or year</li>
                    <li>It appears from a recognisable company name even if unfamiliar</li>
                    <li>You can find a matching email in your inbox</li>
                    <li>The amount is a typical subscription price ($5, $9.99, $14.99, $19.99, etc.)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Signs it might actually be fraud</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The amount is random or unusual (not a standard subscription price)</li>
                    <li>You find no email receipt anywhere</li>
                    <li>The charge is from a country you've never interacted with</li>
                    <li>Multiple small charges appear in quick succession</li>
                    <li>The merchant name is completely ungooglable</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you genuinely believe it's fraud, contact your bank immediately. If it's a forgotten subscription, cancel it directly with the company rather than disputing it — this avoids complications and is faster.</p>

                <h2 id="what-to-do">What to do about it</h2>
                <p>Once you've identified a charge, you have three options:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Keep it</strong> — if you still use it and it's worth the money</li>
                    <li><strong>Cancel it</strong> — go directly to the service's website and cancel through their account settings. Don't rely on your bank to do this — cancelling your card doesn't always stop subscription charges.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dispute it</strong> — only do this if you genuinely believe it's fraudulent and the company won't refund you directly</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The bigger issue is that this happens repeatedly. You clear out your subscriptions today, but six months from now you'll have a new set of charges you don't recognise. Free trials auto-convert, prices change, and new services creep in.</p>

                <p>The only real solution is something that watches your spending automatically and alerts you the moment something unfamiliar or unexpected appears — so you deal with it immediately rather than months later.</p>
