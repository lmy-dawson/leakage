1. THE CORE POSITIONING (THIS IS EVERYTHING)

You are not building:

a budgeting app

a finance dashboard

a subscription tracker

Those are crowded and boring.

You are building a Subscription Autopsy.

That phrase matters because:
• it implies something went wrong
• it implies insight, not tracking
• it implies judgment and clarity

People don’t want another list.
They want someone to tell them what’s wasting their money.

2. NAME OPTIONS (OPINIONATED)

Pick one. Don’t bikeshed.

Top recommendation

Leakage
Tagline: Find where your money quietly leaks.

Why this works:
Short. Serious. Slightly uncomfortable. Not playful fintech nonsense.

Other viable options

SubCut – blunt, action-oriented

Bleed – risky but memorable

SilentCharges – descriptive, less brandable

PayDrain – clear, maybe too literal

I’d pick Leakage if you want something that can grow.

3. ONE-SENTENCE VALUE PROPOSITION

This must be above the fold.

“We show you which subscriptions are quietly wasting your money — and what to do about them.”

Notice:
• no AI buzzwords
• no “manage” or “track”
• clear outcome

If this sentence doesn’t make someone nod, the idea is dead.

4. HOW THE PRODUCT FEELS (IMPORTANT)

Tone:
• calm
• factual
• slightly judgmental but not rude
• “adult in the room” energy

This is not a fun app.
It’s a mirror.

5. WEBSITE STRUCTURE (FAKE-DOOR READY)

You can build this in Webflow, Carrd, or plain HTML.

SECTION 1 — HERO

Headline

You’re paying for subscriptions you don’t use.

Subheadline

Leakage finds recurring charges, explains what they are, and tells you which ones are worth keeping.

Primary CTA

Get early access

Secondary (optional):

See how it works (scroll)

SECTION 2 — THE PAIN (CALL IT OUT)

People convert when they feel seen.

Text:

Most subscriptions don’t feel expensive.
That’s why they slip through.

$7 here. $12 there.
Old trials. Tools you “might need someday.”

Leakage exists to call that out.

This works because it narrates their inner monologue.

SECTION 3 — WHAT IT DOES (SIMPLE, NOT TECHNICAL)

Three steps. No diagrams needed.

1. We scan

Connect your email or upload a bank statement.

2. We analyze

We identify recurring charges and explain what each one actually is.

3. We judge

You’ll see which subscriptions are likely wasted — and which ones earn their place.

That word “judge” is intentional. It’s different.

SECTION 4 — WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT (THIS MATTERS)

Competitors list subscriptions. You don’t.

Bullet copy:

Not just a list — an explanation

Not budgeting — decision support

Not alerts — recommendations

No spreadsheets

No guilt trips

You’re reframing the category.

SECTION 5 — SOCIAL PROOF (EVEN IF FAKE-DOOR)

Since it’s pre-launch, use conceptual proof.

Example:

“I had no idea I was still paying for half of these.”
— Early tester

That’s enough. Don’t overdo it.

SECTION 6 — EMAIL CAPTURE (THE REAL GOAL)

Headline

Want to stop wasting money quietly?

Sub

Join the waitlist. Early users get free analysis when we launch.

CTA

Join the waitlist

That incentive costs you nothing and boosts conversion.

6. WHY THIS WILL ATTRACT USERS (HONESTLY)

This works because:
• subscription fatigue is constant
• people feel mild shame (which drives action)
• competitors avoid being opinionated
• your promise is narrow and believable

Most fintech products try to be your “financial partner.”
That’s vague and exhausting.

You’re saying:
“I’ll tell you what to cancel.”

That’s clarity. Clarity converts.

7. WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT BUILD YET

Do not build:

bank integrations

dashboards

automation

cancellation flows

For validation:
You only need:
• the landing page
• email capture
• maybe a fake “upload statement” screen later

If people sign up → you earned the right to build.

8. STRONG FINAL ADVICE (READ THIS TWICE)

Do not soften the message.
Do not add features.
Do not explain AI.
Do not try to be nice.

The moment this becomes polite, it becomes ignorable.

Launch the page.
Let the market either flinch or shrug.

If it flinches, you’re onto something real.
